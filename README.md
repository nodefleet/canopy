### ‚´∏ **Welcome to the Network that Powers the Peer-to-Peer Launchpad for New Chains**

Built on a recursive architecture, chains bootstrap each other into independence ‚Äî  
forming an `unstoppable` web of utility and security. 

**Here you'll find:**

‚û™ A recursive framework to build blockchains.

‚û™ The seed chain that started the recursive cycle.

## Network Status

‚™¢ Canopy is in `Betanet` üöÄ ‚ûù learn more about the [road-to-mainnet](https://www.canopynetwork.org/learn-more/road-to-mainnet)

## Protocol Documentation

‚û™ Check out the Canopy Network wiki:  [https://canopy-network.gitbook.io/docs](https://canopy-network.gitbook.io/docs)

## Repository Documentation

Welcome to the Canopy Network reference implementation. This repository can be well understood reading about the core modules:

- [Controller](controller/README.md): Coordinates communication between all the major parts of the Canopy blockchain, like a central hub or "bus" that connects the system together.
- [Finite State Machine (FSM)](fsm/README.md): Defines the logic for how transactions change the blockchain's state ‚Äî it decides what‚Äôs valid and how state transitions happen from one block to the next.
- [Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Consensus](bft/README.md): A consensus mechanism that allows the network to agree on new blocks even if some nodes are unreliable or malicious.
- [Peer-to-Peer Networking](p2p/README.md): A secure and encrypted communication system that lets nodes talk directly to each other without needing a central server.
- [Persistence](store/README.md): Manages the blockchain‚Äôs storage ‚Äî it saves the current state (ledger), indexes past transactions, and ensures fast and reliable data verification.

## How to Run It

‚û™ To run the Canopy binary, use the following commands:

```bash
make build/canopy-full
canopy start
```

## How to Run It with üê≥ Docker

‚û™ To run a Canopy `Localnet` in a *containerized* environment, use the following commands:
```bash
make docker/build
make docker/up-fast
make docker/logs

or simply

make docker/up && make docker/logs
```

## Running Tests

‚û™ To run Canopy unit tests, use the Go testing tools:

```bash
make test
```
